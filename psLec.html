                1: "professional skill offers a comprehensive approach to developing workplace readiness through practical assignments and hands-on learning. The course structure revolves around three major components that build essential career skills. Students will first tackle job application fundamentals by creating their CV, crafting a cover letter, and experiencing a mock interview, which accounts for 30% of the final grade. The second component involves organizing a food festival and documenting the experience in a report, worth 20% of the grade. This practical project helps develop event management and documentation skills. The final and most significant component, weighted at 50%, focuses on self-reflection through portfolio development and presentation, encouraging students to think deeply about their professional growth.<br><br>The course emphasizes active participation, with a mandatory 80% attendance requirement, showing its focus on practical learning rather than just theoretical knowledge. Using the enrollment key PS2024, students gain access to a learning environment that combines individual tasks with group projects, helping them develop both personal and collaborative professional skills. The 100% continuous assessment structure means students can demonstrate their abilities through practical work rather than traditional exams, making the learning experience more relevant to real-world workplace scenarios. This approach helps students build confidence and competence in essential workplace skills while providing them with tangible examples of their capabilities to share with future employers.",
                2: "This lecture provides comprehensive instruction on two essential job application documents: the CV and cover letter. The CV portion teaches students how to create a professional document that effectively presents their qualifications, experience, and skills to potential employers. It emphasizes the importance of proper formatting, clear organization, and strategic content selection to make a strong first impression. The lesson also covers how to tailor CVs to specific job applications by highlighting relevant qualifications and incorporating keywords from job descriptions.<br><br>The cover letter section builds on this foundation by showing students how to craft compelling introductory letters that complement their CVs. Using practical examples and templates, the lesson demonstrates how to structure a professional business letter, connect your qualifications to job requirements, and persuasively communicate your value to potential employers. The material includes hands-on exercises where students practice filling in letter templates and analyzing the function of different paragraphs in effective cover letters.<br><br>Throughout both sections, there's a strong focus on practical application and avoiding common mistakes. The inclusion of real-world examples, like the sample CV format for both academic and corporate sectors, helps students understand how these documents should look and function in actual job applications. This practical knowledge directly supports the course's first assignment, which requires students to create their own CV, write a cover letter, and participate in mock interviews, accounting for 30% of their final grade.<br><br>he lesson structure reflects a thoughtful progression from understanding basic concepts to applying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring students develop the skills needed for successful job applications. Through interactive exercises and peer review sessions, students gain hands-on experience in crafting these crucial professional documents while receiving constructive feedback to improve their work.",
                3: "A successful job interview requires both strong verbal and non-verbal communication abilities. The lecture emphasizes that interviews are two-way conversations where both parties seek information - employers evaluate candidates' qualifications while candidates learn about the role and organization.<br><br>The material covers several key areas of interview preparation:<br><br>Communication plays a vital role, with 93% of face-to-face communication happening through non-verbal channels - 55% through body language, 38% through tone of voice, and only 7% through actual words. The lecture teaches the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for structuring interview responses effectively.<br><br>Professional presentation is crucial - the lecture includes detailed guidance on appropriate business attire and grooming standards. For men, this means a well-fitted suit with dress shirt and tie, while women should opt for either a tailored suit or professional dress in neutral colors.<br><br>The evaluation criteria for mock interviews assess both verbal behaviors (like clear communication, active listening, and demonstrating knowledge) and non-verbal elements (such as eye contact, posture, and professional appearance). Students practice these skills through mock interviews where they take turns as interviewer and interviewee, using a detailed rubric for feedback.<br><br>The lecture emphasizes that preparation is key - researching the company, understanding the role, anticipating common questions, and practicing responses. This structured approach helps candidates present themselves confidently and competently during actual job interviews.",
                4: "We learned bout different portfolio types - like personal ones 4 showing creative work, career ones 4 job hunting, n assessment ones 4 tracking learning.

                6: "Today I learned important lessons about professional email writing. Emails should have proper structure with clear subject lines, appropriate greetings, and organized content. When writing to employers or colleagues, we need to maintain formality by using 'Dear Mr./Ms.' instead of casual greetings. It's crucial to write complete sentences with good grammar, avoid text-speak shortcuts, and never use all caps or too many exclamation points. Before hitting send, always check for spelling mistakes and make sure the tone stays professional. Professional email addresses should use real names rather than nicknames or random numbers. Following these rules helps create a good impression and shows respect for the recipient's time and position. When following up, patience is important - wait a reasonable time before sending reminders and keep the tone polite but firm. For job applications or meeting requests, having ready-to-use templates can help maintain consistent professional communication.",
                7: "Research design and abstract writing form crucial elements of academic work. During these lectures, we explored how research blueprints guide studies and ensure relevance to research problems. I found it fascinating how research approaches split into two main paths - the numbers-focused quantitative route and the deeper, meaning-focused qualitative path. The choice between them really depends on whether you're trying to prove something with statistics or understand peoples' experiences in depth.<br><br>What really clicked was learning about abstracts - those short but mighty paragraphs that can make or break whether someone reads your whole paper. They're like movie trailers for research, needing to pack the whole story - the (why), the (how), and the 'what we found' - into roughly 250 words. The examples showed how different fields handle this differently, like how history papers might focus more on argument while engineering ones highlight technical results.<br><br>The practical side was super helpful too. Things like choosing between surveys or interviews, picking the right size group to study, and using tools like SPSS or NVIVO to make sense of all the data. It's interesting how some researchers even mix both approaches - like checking both test scores and student experiences to understand learning outcomes.",

We looked at key ideas like understanding project basics, identifying different types of proposals, and learning proper proposal formats. One neat thing about the course is how it breaks down each part of a proposal into clear steps, making the whole process easier to grasp.<br><br>Another helpful part focuses on money matters and getting projects funded. We talked about real ways to explain your needs to funders and make a strong case for support. The workshop showed how to create good budget plans and estimate costs accurately. Having these skills means we can write better proposals that have a higher chance of getting approved.<br><br>The teaching style mixed different learning activities, like group work and real-world examples, to help us understand better. We practiced writing proposal sections and learned tricks for making our ideas clear to readers. This hands-on approach helped me see how these skills would work in real situations.<br><br>A big takeaway was learning about project management tools, like activity plans and schedules. These tools help keep projects organized and on track. We also learned good habits like always preparing thoroughly before writing and thinking carefully about who will read our proposal.

We talked about two important ideas - BATNA (which means having a backup plan) and ZOPA (finding where both sides can agree). I now understand that good negotiation isn't just about getting what you want, but finding solutions that work for everyone.<br><br>The lecture showed me cool tricks like staying calm, listening carefully, and watching how people act when they talk. I really liked learning about body language and how to read what people mean even when they don't say it. We also did some fun role-playing to practice these skills.<br><br>One big thing I learned was that sometimes it's okay to walk away from a deal if it's not right. The teacher used real examples, like asking for a better salary, which made it easy to understand. I now feel more confident about handling different kinds of negotiations, whether at work or in everyday life.<br><br>The whole workshop taught me that good negotiation is like a skill you can get better at with practice. It's not about winning or losing, but about finding good answers for both sides. I especially liked the part about building trust and keeping good relationships while making deals."
